## Step 1: Collect Updates

- Ask each participant (or the user summarizing) for:
  - What was done since last check‑in
  - What will be done next
  - Any blockers or risks

## Step 2: Aggregate

- Summarize status and blockers into an internal outline.

## Step 3: Record

- Optionally update a daily log or note under `.windsurf/memory/scrum/`.
- Surface blockers for possible handoff (PM/Dev/Commander).
